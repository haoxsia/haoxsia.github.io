Nano-/micro-electromechanical systems (NEMS/MEMS) that allow mechanical degrees of freedom (e.g. displacement) to couple with electrical signals are promising devices for fundamental research, in particular for sensing tiny mass [^1], force [^2] and motion [^3]. Recent examples have implemented the nonlinearity or mechanical transduction design to realize logic gates [^4] or RF amplifiers [^5]. Nowadays, the phonon-cavity schemes existed in optomechanics have been explored for investigating electromechanical coupling. Similar to light-matter interaction in the optical domain, optomechanics consisting of mechanical phonons coupled to "microwave" cavity phonons enables a phenomenon of "phonon" interferences. In very recent years, the coupling between two different individual mechanical resonators in microwave circuits has been built for observing their entanglement [^6]. The coupling between multimodes in single mechanical resonator has also been created for sensing a single nanoparticle [^7]. For these reasons, the establishment of the coupling between different resonators with compact structures is still promising.

# Schematic of coupling two distinct mechanical resonators
Silicon nitride (SiN) mechanical resonators with high mechanical properties (e.g. tensile stress) are promising devices for fundamental research and applications. To achieve high quality factor while enabling electromechanical strong coupling in electrical integrated circuits, here we present developing silicon nitride mechanical resonator.

Figs.(a-g) show the fabrication process of silicon nitride drum mechanical resonators.
We define the diameter of the drum by using electron beam (EB) resist CSAR62 to pattern circularly symmetric
holes. The drum is released from the Si substrate by reactive ion etching (RIE) of the SiN
layer (SF6 : Ar = 10 sccm : 10 sccm, for 6.5 min) through these opened holes, followed by a
selective XeF2 silicon etching. These holes occupy about 40 % ~ 45 % of the SiN drum area.
Its suspended top-gate is fabricated by using EB resist PMMA as a top-gate support through
soft-bake at the temperature of 140 centidegree and reflowed at 180 centidegree. Then, we deposit the second
layer EB resist MMA (methyl methacrylate) on the top of the support resist and pattern the
gate structure. For the metal depositions, we first perform Ar ion etching process to clean
the sample and then use with electron beam evaporation to deposition the thin films. All
bonding pads on the chip are designed to be 50 Ohm impedance for microwave signals.
